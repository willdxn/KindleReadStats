Please see https://jakelee.co.uk/analysing-5-years-of-amazon-kindle-reading/ for details on how to obtain the input zip file from Amazon.

Once that is done, just install the dependencies and run the script with the zip file renamed to "data.zip" in the same folder. 

*Plan is for this to be a web app eventually and for you to also be able to import data directly from the Kindle when it is mounted to a computer via USB.*
